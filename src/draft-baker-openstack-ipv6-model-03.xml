    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>OpenStack, and its issues.</t>

      <section anchor="projects" title="What is OpenStack?">
        <t>OpenStack is a cloud computing orchestration solution developed
        using an open source community process. It consists of a collection of
        'projects', each implementing the creation, control, and
        administration of tenant resources. There are separate OpenStack
        projects for managing compute, storage and network resources.</t>

        <t>Neutron is the project that manages OpenStack networking. It
        exposes a "northbound" (e.g., application-facing) API to the other
        OpenStack projects for programmatic control over tenant network
        connectivity. The "southbound" (driver) interface is implemented as
        one or more device driver plugins that are built to interact with
        specific devices in the network. This approach provides the
        flexibility to deploy OpenStack networking using a range of
        alternative techniques.</t>

        <t>An OpenStack tenant, in the Kilo and earlier releases, is required
        to create what OpenStack identifies as a 'Neutron Network' connecting
        their virtual machines. This Network is instantiated via the plugins
        as either a layer 2 network, a layer 3 network, or as an overlay
        network. The actual implementation is unknown to the tenant. The
        technology used to provide these networks is selected by the OpenStack
        operator based upon the requirements of the cloud deployment.</t>

        <t>The tenant also is required, in the Kilo and earlier releases, to
        specify an 'IP Subnet' for each Network. This specification is made by
        providing a CIDR prefix for IPv4 address allocation via DHCP or for
        IPv6 address allocation via DHCP or SLAAC. This address range may be
        from within the address range of the data center (non-overlapping), or
        overlapping <xref target="RFC1918"/> addresses. Tenants may create
        multiple Networks, each with its own Subnet.</t>

        <t>An OpenStack Subnet is a logical layer 2 network and requires layer
        3 routing for packets to exit the Subnet. This is achieved by
        attaching the Subnet to a Neutron Router. The Neutron router
        implements Network Address Translation for external traffic from
        tenant networks as well for providing connectivity to tenant networks
        from the outside. Using Linux utilities, OpenStack can support
        overlapping RFC 1918 addresses between tenants.</t>

        <t>OpenStack Subnets are typically implemented as VLANs in a data
        center. When tenant scalability requirements grow large, an overlay
        approach is typically used. Because of the difficulties in scaling and
        administering large layer 2 and/or overlay networks, some OpenStack
        integrations chose not to provide isolated Subnets and simply offer
        tenants a layer 3 based network alternative.</t>

        <t>OpenStack uses Layer 3 and Layer 2 Linux utilities on hosts to
        provide protection against IP/MAC spoofing and ARP poisoning.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="openstack-issues" title="OpenStack Scaling Issues">
        <t>One of the fundamental requirements of OpenStack Networking
        (Neutron) is to provide scalable, isolated tenant networks. Today this
        is achieved via L2 segmentation using either a) standard 802.1Q VLANs
        or b) an overlay approach based on one of several L2 over L3
        encapsulation techniques available today such as 802.1ad, VXLAN, STT
        or NVGRE.</t>

        <t>However, these approaches still struggle to provide scalable,
        transparent, manageable, high performance, isolated tenant networks.
        VLAN's don't scale beyond 4096 (2^12) networks and have complex
        trunking requirements when tenants span host and racks. IEEE 802.1ad
        (QinQ) partially solves that, but adds another limit - at most 2^12
        tenants, each of which may have 2^12 VLANs. IP Encapsulation
        introduces additional complexity on host computers running hypervisors
        as well as impact performance of tenant applications running on
        virtual machines. Overlay based isolation techniques may also impair
        traditional network monitoring and performance management tools.
        Moreover, when these isolated (L2) networks require external access to
        other networks or the public Internet, they require even more complex
        solutions to accommodate overlapping IP prefixes and network address
        translation (NAT).</t>

        <t>As more capabilities are built on to these layer 2 based
        &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; networks, complexity continues to grow.</t>

        <t>This draft presents a new Layer 3 based approach to OpenStack
        networking using IPv6 that can be deployed natively on IPv6 networks.
        It will be shown that this approach can provide tenant isolation
        without the limitations of existing alternatives, as well as deliver
        high performance networks transparently using a simplified tenant
        network connectivity model, without the overhead of encapsulation or
        managing overlapping IP addresses and address translations. We note
        that some large content providers, notably Google and <xref
        target="FaceBook-IPv6">Facebook</xref>, are going in exactly this
        direction.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="require" title="Requirements">
      <t>In this section, we attempt to list critical requirements.</t>

      <section anchor="approach" title="Design approach">
        <t>As a design approach, we presume an IPv6-only data center in a
        world that might have IPv4 or IPv6 clients outside of it. This design
        explicitly does not depend on VLANs, QinQ, VXLAN, MPLS, Segment
        Routing, LISP, IP/IP or GRE tunnels, or any other supporting
        encapsulation. Data center operators remain free to use any of those
        tools, but they are not required. If we can do everything required for
        OpenStack networking with IPv6 alone, these other networking
        technologies may be used as optimizations. If we are unable to satisfy
        the OpenStack requirements that also is something we wish to know and
        understand.</t>

        <t>OpenStack is designed to be used by many cloud users or 'tenants'.
        Scalable, secure and isolated tenant networks are a requirement for
        building a multi-tenant cloud data center. The OpenStack
        administrator/operator can design and configure a cloud environment to
        provide network isolation using the approach described in this
        document, alone, or in combination with any of the above network
        technologies . However, all the details of the underlying technology
        and implementation details are completely transparent to the tenant
        itself.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="multicenter" title="Multiple Data Centers">
        <t>A common requirement in network and data center operations is
        reliability, serviceability, and maintainability of their operations
        in the presence of an outage. At minimum, this implies multihoming in
        the sense of having multiple upstream ISPs; in many cases, it also
        implies multiple and at times duplicate data centers, and tenants
        stretched or able to be readily moved or recreated across multiple
        data centers.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="large" title="Large Data Centers">
        <t><xref target="Microsoft-Azure">Microsoft Azure</xref> has purchased
        a 100 acre piece of land for the construction of a single data center.
        In terms of physical space, that is enough for a data center with
        about half a million 19' RETMA racks.</t>

        <t>With even modest virtual machine density, infrastructure at this
        scale easily exhausts the 16M available RFC 1918 private addresses
        (i.e. 10.0.0.0/8) and explains the recent efforts by webscale cloud
        providers to deploy IPv6 throughout their new datacenters.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="multitenant" title="Multi-tenancy">
        <t>While it is possible that a single tenant would require a 100 acre
        data center, it would be unusual. In most such data centers, one would
        expect a large number of tenants.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="isolation" title="Isolation">
        <t>Isolation is required between tenants, and at times between tenants
        hierarchically related to larger tenants.</t>

        <section anchor="interisolation" title="Inter-tenant isolation">
          <t>A 'tenant' is defined as a set of resources under common
          administrative control. It may be appropriate for tenants to
          communicate with each other within the context of an application or
          relationships among their owners or operators. However, unless
          specified otherwise, tenants are intended to operate as if they were
          on their own company's premises and be isolated from one
          another.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="intraisolation" title="Intra-tenant isolation">
          <t>There are often security compartments within a corporate network,
          just as there are security barriers between companies. As a result,
          there is a recursive isolation requirement: it must be possible to
          isolate an identified part of a tenant (which we also think of as a
          tenant) from another part of the same tenant.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="requirement5" title="Operational Simplicity">
        <t>To the extent possible (and, for operators, the concept will bring
        a smile), operation of a multi-location multi-tenant data center, and
        the design of an application that runs in one, should be simple and
        uncoupled.</t>

        <t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC3439"/>, this requires that the
        operational model required to support a tenant with only two physical
        machines, or virtual machines in the same physical chassis, should be
        the same as that required to support a tenant running a million
        machines in a federated multiple data center application.
        Additionally, this same operational model should scale from running a
        single tenant up to many thousands of tenants.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="requirement8" title="Address space ">
        <t>As described in <xref target="projects"/>, currently, an OpenStack
        tenant is required to specify a Subnet's CIDR prefix for IP address
        allocation. With this proposal, this is no longer required.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="requirement9" title="Data Center Federation">
        <t>It must be possible to extend the architecture across multiple data
        centers. These data centers may be operated by distinct entities, with
        security policies that apply to their interconnection.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="pmtu" title="Path MTU Issues">
        <t>An issue in virtualized data center architectures is <xref
        target="RFC1981">Path MTU Discovery</xref> implementation.
        Implementing Path MTU requires the <xref
        target="RFC4443">ICMPv6</xref> Packet Too Big message to get from the
        originating router or middleware to the indicated host, which is in
        this case virtual and potentially hidden within a tunnel. This is a
        special case of the issues raised in <xref target="RFC2923"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="models" title="Models">
      <t/>

      <section anchor="configuration" title="Configuration Model">
        <t>In the OpenStack model, the cloud computing user, or tenant, is
        building something Edward Yourdon might call a 'structured design' for
        the application they are building. In the 1960's, when Yourdon started
        specifying process and data flow diagrams, these were job steps in a
        deck of Job Control Language cards; in OpenStack, they are multiple,
        individual machines, virtual or physical, running parts of a
        structured application.</t>

        <t>In these, one might find a load balancer that receives and
        distributes requests to request processors, a set of stored data
        processing applications, and the storage they depend on. What is
        important to the OpenStack tenant is that 'this' and 'that'
        communicate, potentially using or not using multicast communications,
        and don't communicate with 'the other'. Typically unnecessary is any
        and all information regarding how this communication actually needs to
        occur (i.e., placement of routers, switches, and IP subnets, prefixes,
        etc.).</t>

        <t>An IPv6 based networking model simplifies the configuration of
        tenant connectivity requirements. Global reachability eliminates the
        need for network address translation devices as well as
        tenant-specified Subnet prefixes (<xref target="requirement8"/>),
        although tenant-specified ULA prefixes or prefixes from the owner of
        the tenant's address space are usable with it. With the exception of
        network security functions, no network devices need to be specified or
        configured to provide connectivity.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="addressing" title="Data Center Model">
        <t>The premises of the routing and addressing models are that <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>The address tells the routing system what topological location
            to deliver a packet to, and within that, what interface to deliver
            it to, and</t>

            <t>The routing system should deliver traffic to a resource if and
            only if the sender is authorized to communicate with that
            resource.</t>

            <t>Contrary to the OpenStack Neutron Networking Model, tunnels are
            not necessary to provide tenant network isolation; we include
            resources in a tenant network by a Role-based Access Control
            model, but address the tenant resources within the data center in
            a manner that scales for the data center.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>We expect to find the data center to be composed of some minimal
        unit of connectivity and maintenance, such as a rack or row, and
        equipped with one or more Top-of-Rack or End-of-Row switch(es); each
        configured with at least one subnet prefix, perhaps one per such
        switch. For the purposes of this note, these will be called Racks and
        Top-of-Rack switches, and when applied to other architectures the
        appropriate translation needs to be imposed.</t>

        <t><xref target="zynga"/> describes a relatively typical rack design.
        It is a simple fat-tree architecture, with every device in a pair, so
        that any failure has an immediate hot backup. There are other common
        designs, such as those that consider each rack to be in a 'row' and in
        a 'column', with one or more distribution switches in each.</t>

        <section anchor="tenant" title="Tenant Address Model">
          <t>Tenant resources need to be told, by configuration or naming, the
          addresses of resources they communicate with. This is true
          regardless of their location or relationship to a given tenant. In
          environments with well-known addresses, this becomes complex and
          unscalable. This was learned very early with Internet hostnames; a
          single 'hostfile' was maintained by a central entity and updated
          daily, which quickly became unwieldy. The result was the development
          of the Domain Name System; the level of indirection between names
          and addresses improved scalability. It also facilitated ongoing
          maintenance. If a service needed multiple servers, or a server
          needed to change its address, that was trivially solved by changing
          the DNS Resource Record; every resource that needed the new address
          would obtain it the next time it queried the DNS. It has also
          facilitated the IPv4/IPv6 transition; a resource that has an IPv6
          address is given a AAAA record in addition to, or to replace, its
          IPv4 A record.</t>

          <t>Similarly, today's reliance on NAPT technology frequently limits
          the capabilities of an application. It works reasonably well for a
          client accessing a client/server application when the protocol does
          not carry addressing information. If there is an expectation that
          one resource's private address will be meaningful to a peer, such as
          when an SIP client presents its address in SDP or an HTTP server
          presents an address in a redirection, either the resource needs to
          understand the difference between an 'inside' and an 'outside'
          address and know which is which, or it needs a traversal algorithm
          that changes the addresses. For peer-to-peer applications, this
          ultimately means providing a network design in which those issues
          don't apply.</t>

          <t>IPv6 provides global addresses, enough of them that there is no
          real expectation of running out any time soon, making these issues
          go away. In addition, with the IPv4 address space running out, both
          globally and within today's large datacenters, there aren't
          necessarily addresses available for an IPv4 application to use, even
          as a floating IP address.</t>

          <t>Hence, the model we propose is that a resource in a tenant is
          told the addresses of the other resources with which it
          communicates. They are IPv6 addresses, and the data center takes
          care to ensure that inappropriate communications do not take
          place.</t>

                   title="Use of Global Unicast Addresses by Tenants">
            <t>A unicast address in an IP network identifies a topological
            location, by association with an IP prefix (which might be for a
            subnet or any aggregate of subnets). It also identifies a single
            interface located within that subnet, which may or may not be
            instantiated at the time. We assume that there is a subnet
            associated with a top-of-rack switch or whatever its counterpart
            would be in a given network design, and that the physical and
            virtual machines located in that rack have addresses in that
            subnet. This is the same prefix that is used by the datacenter
            administrator.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="ula" title="Unique Local Addresses">
            <t>A common requirement is that tenants have the use of some form
            of private address space. In an IPv6 network, a <xref
            target="RFC4193">Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Address</xref> may be
            used to accomplish this. In this case, however, the addresses will
            need to be explicitly assigned to physical or virtual machines
            used by the tenant, perhaps using DHCP or YANG, where a standard
            IPv6 address could be allocated using SLAAC, DHCPv6, or other
            technologies.</t>

            <t>The value of this is that the distinction between a Global
            Address and a Unique Local Address is a corner case in the data
            center; a ULA will not generally be useful when communicating
            outside the data center, but within the data center it is
            rational. Tenants have no routing information or other awareness
            of the prefix. This is not intended for use behind a NAPT;
            resources that need accessibility to or from resources outside the
            tenant, and especially outside the data center, need global
            addresses.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="multicast" title="Multicast Domains">
            <t>Multicast capability is a capability enjoyed by some groups of
            resources, that enables them to send a single message and have it
            delivered to multiple destinations roughly simultaneously. At the
            link layer, this means sending a message once that is received by
            a specified set of recipient resources using hardware
            capabilities. IP multicast can be implemented on a LAN as
            specified in <xref target="RFC4291"/>, and can also cross multiple
            subnets directly, using routing protocols such as <xref
            target="RFC4601">Protocol Independent Multicast</xref> <xref
            target="RFC4602"/> <xref target="RFC4604"/> <xref
            target="RFC4605"/> <xref target="RFC4607"/>. In IPv6, the model
            would be that when a group of resources is created with a
            multicast capability, it is allocated one or more source-specific
            transient group addresses as defined in section 2.7 of that
            RFC.</t>

          <section anchor="ipv4" title="IPv4 Interaction Model">
            <t>OpenStack IPv4 Neutron uses &ldquo;floating IPv4
            addresses&rdquo; &ndash; global or public IPv4 addresses and
            Network Address Translation - to enable remote resources to
            connect to tenant private network endpoints. Tenant end points can
            connect out to remote resources through an &ldquo;External Default
            Gateway&rdquo;. Both of these depend on <xref
            target="RFC2391">NAPT (DNAT/SNAT)</xref> to ensure that IPv4 end
            points are able communicate and at the same time ensure tenant
            isolation.</t>

            <t>If IPv6 is deployed in a data center, there are fundamentally
            three ways a tenant can interact with IPv4 peers: <list
                style="symbols">
                <t>it can run existing IPv4 OpenStack technology in parallel
                with the IPv6 deployment, meaning that IPv4 is present in the
                data center as well, or</t>

                <t>it can translate or encapsulate IPv4 to IPv6, leaving the
                data center IPv6-only.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>If the intention of the data center operator is to give each
            system in the data center a separate global address, It can
            translate an incoming IPv4 address to an internal IPv6 address,
            and have the application see the client or peer as a remote IPv6
            system. This would be as described in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc"/>.</t>

            <t>If the intention of the data center operator is to give each
            system in the data center a separate global address, but the
            application is uses IPv4-only APIs and therefore cannot
            communicate using IPv6, It can translate an incoming IPv4 address
            to an internal IPv6 address, and translate it back in the vSwitch,
            so that the VM is presented with what appears to be an end-to-end
            IPv4 packet. This is described in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc"/>.</t>

            <t>In the event that A+P IPv4 address multiplexing is in view, the
            vSwitch can also implement the mapping of Address and Port using
            either <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"> Encapsulation
            (MAP)</xref> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t">
            Translation (MAP-T)</xref>.</t>

            <t>Running the standard IPv4 OpenStack model and this IPv6 model
            in parallel is complex, if for no other reason than that there are
            two fundamental models in use, one with various encapsulations
            hiding overlapping address space and one with non-overlapping
            address space.</t>

            <t>To simplify the network, as noted in <xref target="approach"/>,
            we suggest that the data center be internally IPv6-only, and IPv4
            be translated or encapsulated to IPv6 at the data center edge. The
            advantage is that it enables IPv4 access while that remains in
            use, and as IPv6 takes over, it reduces the impact of vestigial
            support for IPv4.</t>

            <t>Both translation models in have IPv4 traffic come to an <xref
            target="RFC6145">translator</xref><xref target="RFC6146"/> having
            a pre-configured translation, resulting in an IPv6 packet
            indistinguishable from the packet the remote resource might have
            sent had it been IPv6-capable, with one exception. The IPv6
            destination address is that of the endpoint (the same address
            advertised in a AAAA record), but the source address is an <xref
            target="RFC6052">IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Address</xref> with the IPv4
            address of the sender embedded in a prefix used by the
            translator.</t>

            <t>Access to external IPv4 resources is provided in the same way:
            an <xref target="RFC6147">DNS64</xref> server is implemented that
            contains AAAA records with an <xref target="RFC6052">IPv4-Embedded
            IPv6 Address</xref> with the IPv4 address of the remote resource
            embedded in a prefix used by the translator.</t>

            <t>This follows the <xref target="RFC6144">Framework for IPv4/IPv6
            Translation</xref>, making the internal IPv4 address a floating IP
            address attached to an internal IPv6 address, and the external
            'dial-out' address indistinguishable from a native IPv6
            address.</t>

          <section title="Legacy IPv4 OpenStack">
            <t>The other possible model, applicable to IPv4-only devices, is
            to run a legacy OpenStack environment inside IPv6 tunnels. This
            preserves the data center IPv6-only, and enables IPv4-only
            applications, notably those whose licenses tie them to IPv4
            addresses, to run. However, it adds significant overhead in terms
            of encapsulation size and network management complexity.</t>

        <t>Neutron today already implements a form of <xref

        from emitting traffic with an unauthorized MAC, IPv4, or IPv6 source
        address.</t>

        <t>In addition to this, in this model Neutron prevents the VM from
        transmitting a network packet with an unauthorized label value. The VM
        MAY be configured with and authorized to use one of a short list of
        authorized label values, as opposed to simply having its choice
        overridden; in that case, Neutron verifies the value and overwrites
        one not in the list.</t>

        <t>When a hypervisor is about to deliver an IPv6 packet to a VM, it
        checks the label value against a list of values that the VM is
        permitted to receive. If it contains an unauthorized value, the
        hypervisor discards the packet rather than deliver it. If the Flow
        Label is in use, Neutron zeros the label prior to delivery.</t>

        <t>The intention is to hide the label value from malware potentially
        found in the VM, and enable the label to be used as a form of first
        and last hop security. This provides basic tenant isolation, if the

        <t>If the VM is moved within the same subnet (which usually implies
        the same rack), there is no stitching or renumbering apart from
        ensuring that the MAC address moves with the VM. When the VM moves to
        a different subnet, however, we need to restitch routing, at least
        temporarily. This obviously calls for some definitions. <list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Stitching Routing:">The VM is potentially in

                route to the old address with the VM's address in the new
                subnet as its next hop address. Traffic from VMs from other
                subnets will now follow the host route to the VM in its new

            <t hangText="Renumbering:">This step is optional, but is good

            blankLines="1"/> Note that every IPv6 address, unlike an IPv4
            address, has a lifetime. At least in theory, when the lifetime
            expires, neighbor relationships with the address must be extended
            or the address removed from the system. The <xref
            target="RFC4861">Neighbor Discovery</xref> process in the subnet
            router will periodically emit a Router Advertisement; the VM will
            gain an IPv6 address in the new subnet at that time if not
            earlier. As described in <xref target="RFC4192"/>, DNS should be
            changed to report the new address instead of the old. The DNS
            lifetime and any ambient sessions using the old address are now
            allowed to expire. That this point, any new sessions will be using
            the new address, and the old is vestigial. <vspace
            blankLines="1"/> Waiting for sessions using the address to expire
            can take an arbitrarily long interval, because the session
            generally has no knowledge of the lifetime of the IPv6
            address.</t>

            <t hangText="Unstitching Routing:">This is the reverse process of
            stitching. If the VM is renumbered, when the old address becomes
            vestigial, the address will be discarded by the VM; if the VM is
            subsequently taken out of service, it has the same effect. At that
            point, the host route is withdrawn, and the MAC address in the old
            subnet router's tables is removed.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="isolation"/> and <xref

      and intra-tenant network isolation. It is intended to contribute to the
      security of a network, much like encapsulation in a maze of tunnels or
      VLANs might, but without the complexities and overhead of the management
      of such resources. This does not replace the use of IPSec, SSH, or TLS
      encryption or the use authentication technologies; if these would be
      appropriate in an on-premises corporate data center, they remain
      appropriate in a multi-tenant data center regardless of the isolation
      technology. However, one can think of this as a simple inter-tenant
      firewall based on the concepts of role-based access control; if it can
      be readily determined that a sender is not authorized to communicate
      with a receiver, such a transmission is prevented.</t>

      <t>In this use case, there exist two data centers that one might presume
      are operated by different entities. The two data centers use separate
      address spaces, 2001:db8:1::/48 and 2001:db8:2::/48. One tenant (which
      is to say, a set of systems, virtual or physical, that normally
      communicate with each other), Tenant A, is spread across the two data
      centers, and has a different Tenant ID in each of them. One
      administration has an additional tenant, Tenant B, and the other also
      has an additional tenant, Tenant C. For the sake of amusement, we
      presume that Tenant C, in the right data center, has the same tenant ID
      as Tenant A uses in the left data center. Additionally, Tenant A has a
      "home site" that is authorized to communicate with its data center
      systems.</t>

      <t>From the perspective of communication management, therefore, to
      connect Tenant A to itself and deny all other communications, we need
      four filter rules: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Permit messages from/to 2001:db8:1::/48 with tenant ID
          0xA12345,</t>

          <t>Permit messages from/to 2001:db8:2::/48 with tenant ID
          0xC12345,</t>

          <t>Permit messages from/to 2001:db8:3::/48</t>

          <t>Deny everything else</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Ideally, one would like to apply those rules to the destination
      address at the sender of a packet, and the source address at the
      receiver of a packet. And one would like to do so in a manner that
      minimizes the possibility of disruptive packet filtering such as
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world"/>.</t>

      <t>In addition, one wants a BCP-38 filter, ensuring that packets sent by
      a system (virtual or physical) uses only one of the source addresses it
      is supposed to be using.</t>

      <section anchor="B-label-2460" title="IPv6 Flow Label">
        <t>The IPv6 flow label may be used to identify a tenant or part of a
        tenant, and to facilitate access control based on the flow label
        value. The flow label is a flat 20 bits, facilitating the designation
        of 2^20 (1,048,576) tenants without regard to their location.
        1,048,576 is less than infinity, but compared to current data centers
        is large, and much simpler to manage.</t>

        <t>Note that this usage differs from the current <xref
        target="RFC6437">IPv6 Flow Label Specification</xref>. It also differs
        from the use of a flow label recommended by the <xref

        target="RFC5673"/>. Within a target domain, the usage may be specified

          <t>A 'Federated Identity', in the words of the Wikipedia, 'is the
          means of linking an electronic identity and attributes, stored
          across multiple distinct identity management systems.' In this
          context, it is a fairly weak form of that; it is intended for quick
          interpretation in an access list at the Internet layer as opposed to
          deep analysis for login or other security purposes at the
          application layer, and rather than identifying an individual or a
          system, it identifies a set of systems whose members are authorized
          to communicate freely among themselves and may also be authorized to
          communicate with other identified sets of systems. Either two
          systems are authorized to communicate or they are not, and
          unauthorized traffic can be summarily discarded. The identifier is
          defined in a hierarchical fashion, for flexibility and
          scalability.</t>

          <t>'Role-Based Access Control', in this context, applies to groups
          of virtual or physical hosts, not individuals. In the simplest case,
          the several tenants of a multi-tenant data center might be
          identified, and authorized to communicate only with other systems
          within the same 'tenant' or with identified systems in other tenants
          that manage external access. One could imagine a company purchasing
          cloud services from multiple data center operators, and as a result
          wanting to identify the systems in its tenant in one cloud service
          as being authorized to communicate with the systems its tenant of
          the other. One could further imagine a given department within that
          company being authorized to speak only with itself and an identified
          set of other departments within the same company. To that end, when
          a datagram is sent, it is tagged with the federated identify of the
          sender (e.g., {datacenter, client, department}), and the receiving
          system filters traffic it receives to limit itself to a specific set
          of authorized communicants.</t>

          identifying Company A and its internal structure. If Company A uses
          the services of both multi-tenant data centers #1 and #2, and they
          are federated, the identifier might need to identify the data

      <section anchor="Appendix_UCC" title="Universal Cloud Classification">
        <section anchor="UCC_Intro" title="Introduction">
          <t>Cloud environments suffer from ambiguity in identifying their
          services and tenants. Traffic from different cloud providers cannot
          be distinguished easily on the Internet. Filters are simply not able
          to obtain the provider, service and tenant identities from network
          packets without leveraging other more latency intense inspection
          methods. This appendix describes the Universal Cloud Classification
          (UCC) <xref target="UCC"/> approach as a way to identify cloud
          providers, their services and tenants on the network layer. It
          introduces a Cloud-ID, Service-ID and Tenant-ID. The IDs are
          incorporated into an IPv6 extension header and can be used for
          different use-cases both within and outside a Cloud Environment. The
          format of the IDs and their characteristics are defined in <xref
          target="UCC_Options"/> of the document and the extension header is
          defined in <xref target="UCC_Extensions_Header"/>.</t>

          <t>Applications and users are defined in many different ways in
          cloud environments, therefore ambiguity is multifold:<list
              style="numbers">
              <t>The first ambiguity is described by how a service is defined
              in cloud environments. Here, an application within a Cloud
              Provider is called a service. However, the cloud providers
              network can not distinguish services from services run on top of
              other services. Distinguishing sub-services hosted by a service
              becomes critical when applying network services to specific
              sub-services.</t>

              <t>Secondly, a tenant in a cloud provider can have different
              meanings. Here, tenant is used to define a consumer of a cloud
              service. At the same time a service run on top of another
              service can be considered a tenant of that particular service.
              These ambiguities make it extremely difficult to uniquely
              identify services and their tenants in cloud environments. This
              multi-layered service and tenant relationship is one of the most
              complex tasks to handle using existing technologies.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>A service can be defined as a group of entities offering a
          specific function to a tenant within a Cloud Provider.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="UCC_Options"
                 title="Universal Cloud Classification Options">
          <t>Three IDs are defined that classify a Tenant specific to the
          service used within a certain Cloud Provider. The Cloud-ID,
          Service-ID and Tenant-ID are defined hierarchically and support
          service-stacking. The IDs are based on the 'Digital Object
          Identifier' scheme and support incorporating metadata per ID. The ID
          can be of variable length but Cloud-ID, Service-ID and Tenant-ID are
          proposed within a 4 byte, 6 byte and 6 byte tuple respectively.</t>

          <section anchor="UCC_Cloud_ID" title="Cloud ID">
            <t>The Cloud ID is a globally unique ID that is managed by a
            registrar similar to DNS. It is 4 bytes in sizes and defined with
            a 10 bit location part and a 22 bit provider ID.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="UCC_Service_ID" title="Service ID">
            <t>The Service ID is used to identify a service both within and
            outside a cloud environment. It is a 6 byte long ID that is
            separated into several sub-IDs defining the data center, service
            and an option field. The Data Center location is defined by 8
            bits, the Service is 32 bits long and the Option field provides
            another 8 bits. The option bits can be used to incorporate
            information used for en-route or destination tasks.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="UCC_Tenant_ID" title="Tenant ID">
            <t>The Tenant-ID is classifying consumers (tenants) of Cloud
            Services. It is a 6 byte long ID that is defined and managed by
            the Cloud Provider. Similar to the Service-ID the Tenant-ID
            incorporates metadata specific to that tenant. The MetaData field
            is of variable length and can be defined by the Cloud Provider as
            needed.</t>

        <section anchor="UCC_Extensions_Header" title="UCC Extension Header">
          <t>The UCC proposal <xref target="UCC"/> defines an IPv6 hop-by-hop
          extension header to incorporate the Cloud-ID, Service-ID and
          Tenant-ID. Each ID area also includes bits to define enroute
          behavior for devices understanding/not-understanding the newly
          defined hop-by-hop extension header. This is useful for legacy
          devices on the Internet to avoid drops the packet but forward it

        <t>The approach starts from the observation that Openstack assigns the
        MAC address used by a VM, and can assign it according to any algorithm
        it chooses. A desire has been expressed to put the tenant identifier
        into the IPv6 address. This would put it into the IID in that address

          <t>Walking through the details, an IEEE 802.3 MAC Address (<xref

          other NIC-specific identifier. The intention is to create a globally
          unique address, so that the NIC may be used on any LAN in the world
          without colliding with other addresses.</t>

          <t>OpenStack today specifies a local IEEE 802.3 address (bit 6 is
          one). IPv6 addresses are either installed using DHCP or derived from
          the MAC address via SLAAC.</t>

          <t>One could imagine the MAC address used in an OpenStack
          environment including both a tenant identifier and a system number
          on a LAN. If the tenant identifier is 24 bits (it could be longer or
          shorter, but for this document it is treated as 24 bits), as in
          common in VxLAN and QinQ implementations, that would allow for a 22
          bit system number, plus two magic bits specifying a locally defined
          unicast address, as shown in <xref target="TenantMAC"/>.
          Alternatively, the first byte could be some specified values such as
          0xFA (as is common with current OpenStack implementations), followed
          by a 16 bit system number within the subnet.</t>

          <t>As noted, the Tenant Identifier might be longer or shorter in a
          given implementation. Specifically in <xref target="TenantIPv6"/>, a

          Tenant ID would occupy positions 48..63.</t>

          <t>Following the same model, IPv6 Multicast Addresses can be
          associated with a tenant identifier by placing the tenant identifier
          in the same set of bits and using the remaining bits of the
          Multicast Group ID as the ID within the tenant as show in <xref
          target="TenantMulticast"/>. Flags and scope are as specified in
          <xref target="RFC4291"/> section 2.7. To avoid clashes with
          multicast addresses specified in ibid 2.7.1 and future allocations,
          The Tenant Group ID MUST NOT be zero.</t>

            <t>The fundamental service offered in this model is that the key
            policy parameter, the Tenant ID, is encoded in every datagram for
            both sender and receiver, and can therefore be tested by sender,
            receiver, or any other party. It is secure in the sense that it
            cannot be directly spoofed; in the sender vSwitch, the vSwitch
            prevents the sender from sending another address as discussed in
            <xref target="bcp38"/>, and if the recipient address is a randomly
            chosen address, even if it meets inter-tenant communication
            policy, there is unlikely to be a matching destination to deliver
            it to. Where this breaks down is if a valid and acceptable
            destination is discovered and used; that is the argument for
            further protection via TLS.</t>

          <section title="Pros and Cons">
            <section title="The case in favor of this approach">
              <t>The case in favor of this approach consists of several
              observations: <list style="symbols">
                  <t>Many Cisco customers are using and prefer SLAAC for IPv6
                  clients in OpenStack environments.</t>

                  <t>It is easy to configure this IID from the Neutron
                  Controller without modifying the VM, or it even knowing it
                  happened.</t>

                  <t>From a security perspective, the tenant ID cannot be
                  spoofed per se; the sender of a message is not permitted to
                  send a message from the wrong address or to an unauthorized
                  address.</t>

                  <t>Since it requires no extension headers or other
                  encapsulations, it has no impact on Path MTU.</t>

                  <t>Filters can be applied anywhere, and notably at the
                  sender and the receiver of a message.</t>

              <t>In <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids"/>, the IETF is

          <section title="Filtering considerations">
            <t>In this model, the vSwitch needs, for each VM it manages, two
            access control lists: <list style="symbols">
                <t>Zero or more {IPv6 prefix, tenant ID} pairs; these may be
                read as 'if the IPv6 prefix matches {prefix}, the IID contains
                a tenant ID, and it may be {tenant ID}.'</t>

                <t>Zero or more IPv6 prefixes that the VM is authorized to
                communicate without regard to tenant ID.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Generally speaking, one would expect at least one of those
            three lists to contain an entry - at minimum, the VM would be
            authorized to communicate with ::/0, which is to say 'anyone'.</t>

            <t>Among the generic IPv6 prefixes that may be communicated with,
            there may be zero or more <xref target="RFC6052">IPv4-embedded
            IPv6 prefix</xref> prefixes that the VM is permitted to
            communicate with. For example, if the <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc"/> translation prefix is
            2001:db8:0:1::/96, and the enterprise is using 192.0.2.0/24 as its
            IPv4 address, the filter would contain the prefix
            2001:db8:0:1:0:0:c000:0200/120.</t>

            <t>Note that the lists may also include multicast prefixes as
            specified in <xref target="address-format"/>, such as
            locally-scoped multicast ff01::/104 or locally-scoped multicast
            within the tenant {ff01::/16, tenant id} . While these access
            lists are applied in both directions (as a sender, what prefixes
            may the destination address contain, and as a receiver, what
            prefixes may the source address contain), only the destination
            address may contain multicast addresses. For multicast, therefore,
            the vSwitch should filter <xref target="RFC2710">Multicast
            Listener Discovery</xref> using the multicast subset, permitting
            the VM to only join relevant multicast groups.</t>
