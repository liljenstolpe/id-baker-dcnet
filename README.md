This is the repo for a set of drafts relating to data center / cloud
networking, and OpenStack networking in particular.

Please do work in your own branch, and push that branch to the repo.
That will allow us all to review the changes before we commit to the trunk.

We are using [Kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629).
See [kramdown-rfc-readme](kramdown-rfc-readme.md) for a quick overview.
